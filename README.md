# python-api-challenge.

In this challenge we are analyzing weather data of houndres of cities using the OpenWeatherMap API in a Jupyter Notebook. In WeatherPy.ipynb file we first plot latitude vs weather filers ((temperature, humidity, cloudiness)) and try to analyze if there is correlation between those variables. 

Finally, in VacationPy.ipynb we create a new dataframe with some filters we applied from the previous dataset and we look for the closest hotel to that city.
